            <p>Hello! I am Sofia Jane H. Carvilleda, 19 years of age, and I am from Don Andres Soriano(Lutopan), Toledo
                City,
                Cebu.
                I am taking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Cebu Technological University- Main Campus.

            <h1><span>About Me</span></h1>
            <p>A little fun fact about why my name is Sofia, is because it came from my paternal grandmother whose
                name
                is also
                Sofia.
                My mother originally thought to name me Nathalie, but instead, she named me after my grandmother. My
                second
                name, "Jane," came from my mother's nickname, Jenny, hence "Jane." I am an only child, as my mother
                had
                me at
                the age of 42, which I feel is quite late compared to the typical age many women choose to conceive.
                I
                inherited
                her love for animals, as I have a soft heart when it comes to them. My artistic journey began in
                childhood, when
                I would scribble and doodle on every blank piece of paper I could find. Even now, I still have the
                habit
                of
                filling any empty space I see.

            <h1><span>Education</span></h1>
            <p>I spent my elementary days at Gen.P Del Rosario Elementary School which I graduated as a
                Valedictorian on
                my
                batch.
                I went to Don Andres Soriano National High School for my highschool journey and looking back, I
                could
                say I did
                enjoy my highschool days
                as a Special Science Class student but I wasn't able to fully enjoy it for four years due to the
                pandemic. It
                was like time froze and in a blink of an eye we were graduating SeniorHighschool
                from PAU Excellencia Global Academy Foundation Inc. Currently, I am taking up Bachelor of Science in
                Information
                Technology at CTU-Main Campus.

            <p>Life feels so much better when you start accepting the fact that it is what it is. When you stop forcing
                things that aren't aligned with you and allow things to flow naturally, when you trust that whatever is
                meant for you will find its way to you. </p>
